Steps to run the simulations

Procedure to run the Controller A
```
Step 1: Open the main.m file in Controller A's folder and run it on MATLAB. The system model should open.
Step 2: After the moddel opens, run the model in simulink.
Step 3: To view results, double click on the individual scope to view graphs.
